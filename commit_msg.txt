feat: Enhanced SAFE with Process Simulation and UI Improvements

- Added process simulation for EDR/XDR testing
  - OS-specific process patterns with MITRE mappings
  - Detection guidance for each pattern
  - Generates benign test scripts

- Improved UI/UX
  - Step-by-step workflow guidance
  - Current status display
  - OS-specific icons (🪟 🍎 )
  - Enhanced documentation

- Added threat actor profiles
  - FIN7, APT29 TTPs
  - Detailed IOC patterns
  - MITRE technique mappings

Testing: Validates detection of suspicious:
- Process creation
- Command-line arguments
- Parent-child relationships
- Persistence mechanisms
